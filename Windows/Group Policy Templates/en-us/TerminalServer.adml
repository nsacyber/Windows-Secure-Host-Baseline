      <string id="TS_ENCRYPTION_EXPLAIN">Specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you are using native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is not recommended. This policy does not apply to SSL encryption.

If you enable this policy setting, all communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during remote connections must use the encryption method specified in this setting. By default, the encryption level is set to High. The following encryption methods are available:

* High: The High setting encrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client by using strong 128-bit encryption. Use this encryption level in environments that contain only 128-bit clients (for example, clients that run Remote Desktop Connection). Clients that do not support this encryption level cannot connect to RD Session Host servers.

* Client Compatible: The Client Compatible setting encrypts data sent between the client and the server at the maximum key strength supported by the client. Use this encryption level in environments that include clients that do not support 128-bit encryption.

* Low: The Low setting encrypts only data sent from the client to the server by using 56-bit encryption.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the encryption level to be used for remote connections to RD Session Host servers is not enforced through Group Policy.

Important

FIPS compliance can be configured through the System cryptography. Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing settings in Group Policy (under Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options.) The FIPS compliant setting encrypts and decrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client, with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 encryption algorithms, by using Microsoft cryptographic modules. Use this encryption level when communications between clients and RD Session Host servers requires the highest level of encryption.

By default, the RD Session Host server fallback printer driver is disabled. If the RD Session Host server does not have a printer driver that matches the client's printer, no printer will be available for the Remote Desktop Services session.

If you enable this policy setting, the fallback printer driver is enabled, and the default behavior is for the RD Session Host server to find a suitable printer driver. If one is not found, the client's printer is not available. You can choose to change this default behavior. The available options are:

"Do nothing if one is not found" - If there is a printer driver mismatch, the server will attempt to find a suitable driver. If one is not found, the client's printer is not available. This is the default behavior.

"Default to PCL if one is not found" - If no suitable printer driver can be found, default to the Printer Control Language (PCL) fallback printer driver.

"Default to PS if one is not found" - If no suitable printer driver can be found, default to the PostScript (PS) fallback printer driver.

"Show both PCL and PS if one is not found" - If no suitable driver can be found, show both PS and PCL-based fallback printer drivers.

If you disable this policy setting, the RD Session Host server fallback driver is disabled and the RD Session Host server will not attempt to use the fallback printer driver.

If you do not configure this policy setting, the fallback printer driver behavior is off by default.

This setting applies to an RD Session Host server that is configured to use RD Connection Broker and not to the RD Connection Broker server.

If you enable this policy setting, a Remote Desktop Services client queries the RD Connection Broker server and is redirected to their existing session by using the IP address of the RD Session Host server where their session exists. To use this redirection method, client computers must be able to connect directly by IP address to RD Session Host servers in the farm.

If you disable this policy setting, the IP address of the RD Session Host server is not sent to the client. Instead, the IP address is embedded in a token. When a client reconnects to the load balancer, the routing token is used to redirect the client to their existing session on the correct RD Session Host server in the farm. Only disable this setting when your network load-balancing solution supports the use of RD Connection Broker routing tokens and you do not want clients to directly connect by IP address to RD Session Host servers in the load-balanced farm.

If you enable this policy setting, all communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during remote connections must use the security method specified in this setting. The following security methods are available:

* Negotiate: The Negotiate method enforces the most secure method that is supported by the client. If Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0 is supported, it is used to authenticate the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported, native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is used to secure communications, but the RD Session Host server is not authenticated. Native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is not recommended.

* RDP: The RDP method uses native RDP encryption to secure communications between the client and RD Session Host server. If you select this setting, the RD Session Host server is not authenticated. Native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is not recommended.

You can use this setting to specify a program to run automatically when a user logs on to a remote computer.

By default, Remote Desktop Services sessions provide access to the full Windows desktop, unless otherwise specified with this setting, by the server administrator, or by the user in configuring the client connection. Enabling this setting overrides the "Start Program" settings set by the server administrator or user. The Start menu and Windows Desktop are not displayed, and when the user exits the program the session is automatically logged off.

To use this setting, in Program path and file name, type the fully qualified path and file name of the executable file to be run when the user logs on. If necessary, in Working Directory, type the fully qualified path to the starting directory for the program. If you leave Working Directory blank, the program runs with its default working directory. If the specified program path, file name, or working directory is not the name of a valid directory, the RD Session Host server connection fails with an error message.

If the status is set to Enabled, Remote Desktop Services sessions automatically run the specified program and use the specified Working Directory (or the program default directory, if Working Directory is not specified) as the working directory for the program.

It can be used to require that the desktop be displayed after a client connects to a remote computer, even if an initial program is already specified in the default user profile, Remote Desktop Connection, Remote Desktop Services client, or through Group Policy.

If you enable this policy setting, the desktop is always displayed when a client connects to a remote computer. This policy setting overrides any initial program policy settings.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, an initial program can be specified that runs on the remote computer after the client connects to the remote computer. If an initial program is not specified, the desktop is always displayed on the remote computer after the client connects to the remote computer.

      <string id="TS_USER_AUTHENTICATION_EXPLAIN">This policy setting allows you to specify whether to require user authentication for remote connections to the RD Session Host server by using Network Level Authentication. This policy setting enhances security by requiring that user authentication occur earlier in the remote connection process.

If you enable this policy setting, only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD Session Host server.

To determine whether a client computer supports Network Level Authentication, start Remote Desktop Connection on the client computer, click the icon in the upper-left corner of the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, and then click About. In the About Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, look for the phrase Network Level Authentication supported.

If you disable this policy setting, Network Level Authentication is not required for user authentication before allowing remote connections to the RD Session Host server.

If you do not configure this policy setting, the local setting on the target computer will be enforced. On Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, Network Level Authentication is enforced by default.

To use this setting, select the location for the home directory (network or local) from the Location drop-down list. If you choose to place the directory on a network share, type the Home Dir Root Path in the form \\Computername\Sharename, and then select the drive letter to which you want the network share to be mapped.

If you choose to keep the home directory on the local computer, type the Home Dir Root Path in the form "Drive:\Path" (without quotes), without environment variables or ellipses. Do not specify a placeholder for user alias, because Remote Desktop Services automatically appends this at logon.

Note: The Drive Letter field is ignored if you choose to specify a local path. If you choose to specify a local path but then type the name of a network share in Home Dir Root Path, Remote Desktop Services places user home directories in the network location.

If the status is set to Enabled, Remote Desktop Services creates the user's home directory in the specified location on the local computer or the network. The home directory path for each user is the specified Home Dir Root Path and the user's alias.

      <string id="TS_USER_PROFILES_EXPLAIN">This policy setting allows you to specify the network path that Remote Desktop Services uses for roaming user profiles.

By default, Remote Desktop Services stores all user profiles locally on the RD Session Host server. You can use this policy setting to specify a network share where user profiles can be centrally stored, allowing a user to access the same profile for sessions on all RD Session Host servers that are configured to use the network share for user profiles.

If you enable this policy setting, Remote Desktop Services uses the specified path as the root directory for all user profiles. The profiles are contained in subfolders named for the account name of each user.

To configure this policy setting, type the path to the network share in the form of \\Computername\Sharename. Do not specify a placeholder for the user account name, because Remote Desktop Services automatically adds this when the user logs on and the profile is created. If the specified network share does not exist, Remote Desktop Services displays an error message on the RD Session Host server and will store the user profiles locally on the RD Session Host server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, user profiles are stored locally on the RD Session Host server. You can configure a user's profile path on the Remote Desktop Services Profile tab on the user's account Properties dialog box.

Notes:
1. The roaming user profiles enabled by the policy setting apply only to Remote Desktop Services connections. A user might also have a Windows roaming user profile configured. The Remote Desktop Services roaming user profile always takes precedence in a Remote Desktop Services session.
2. To configure a mandatory Remote Desktop Services roaming user profile for all users connecting remotely to the RD Session Host server, use this policy setting together with the "Use mandatory profiles on the RD Session Host server" policy setting located in Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\RD Session Host\Profiles.

Note:  If you want to limit the size of an individual user profile, use the "Limit profile size" policy setting located in User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\User Profiles.

If you enable this policy setting, you must specify a monitoring interval (in minutes) and a maximum size (in gigabytes) for the entire roaming user profile cache. The monitoring interval determines how often the size of the entire roaming user profile cache is checked. When the size of the entire roaming user profile cache exceeds the maximum size that you have specified, the oldest (least recently used) roaming user profiles will be deleted until the size of the entire roaming user profile cache is less than the maximum size specified.

      <string id="TS_CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN">This policy setting allows you to specify the name of the certificate template that determines which certificate is automatically selected to authenticate an RD Session Host server.

A certificate is needed to authenticate an RD Session Host server when TLS 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2 is used to secure communication between a client and an RD Session Host server during RDP connections.

If you enable this policy setting, you need to specify a certificate template name. Only certificates created by using the specified certificate template will be considered when a certificate to authenticate the RD Session Host server is automatically selected. Automatic certificate selection only occurs when a specific certificate has not been selected.

If no certificate can be found that was created with the specified certificate template, the RD Session Host server will issue a certificate enrollment request and will use the current certificate until the request is completed. If more than one certificate is found that was created with the specified certificate template, the certificate that will expire latest and that matches the current name of the RD Session Host server will be selected.

If you disable or do not configure this policy, the certificate template name is not specified at the Group Policy level. By default, a self-signed certificate is used to authenticate the RD Session Host server.

    <string id="TS_SERVER_COMPRESSOR_EXPLAIN">This policy setting allows you to specify which Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) compression algorithm to use.

By default, servers use an RDP compression algorithm that is based on the server's hardware configuration.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify which RDP compression algorithm to use. If you select the algorithm that is optimized to use less memory, this option is less memory-intensive, but uses more network bandwidth. If you select the algorithm that is optimized to use less network bandwidth, this option uses less network bandwidth, but is more memory-intensive. Additionally, a third option is available that balances memory usage and network bandwidth. In Windows  8 only the compression algorithm that balances memory usage and bandwidth is used.

You can also choose not to use an RDP compression algorithm. Choosing not to use an RDP compression algorithm will use more network bandwidth and is only recommended if you are using a hardware device that is designed to optimize network traffic. Even if you choose not to use an RDP compression algorithm, some graphics data will still be compressed.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default RDP compression algorithm will be used.

When deployed on an RD Virtualization Host server, RemoteFX delivers a rich user experience by rendering content on the server by using graphics processing units (GPUs). By default, RemoteFX for RD Virtualization Host uses server-side GPUs to deliver a rich user experience over LAN connections and RDP 7.1.

When deployed on an RD Session Host server, RemoteFX delivers a rich user experience by using a hardware-accelerated compression scheme.

If you enable this policy setting, RemoteFX will be used to deliver a rich user experience over LAN connections and RDP 7.1.

You can use this policy to balance the network bandwidth usage with the type of graphics experience that is delivered.

Depending on the requirements of your users, you can reduce network bandwidth usage by reducing the screen capture rate. You can also reduce network bandwidth usage by reducing the image quality (increasing the amount of image compression that is performed).

If you have a higher than average bandwidth network, you can maximize the utilization of bandwidth by selecting the highest setting for screen capture rate and the highest setting for image quality.

By default, Remote Desktop Connection sessions that use RemoteFX are optimized for a balanced experience over LAN conditions. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Remote Desktop Connection sessions that use RemoteFX will be the same as if the medium screen capture rate and the medium image compression settings were selected (the default behavior).
