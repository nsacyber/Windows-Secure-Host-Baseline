If you enable this policy setting, specify the threshold file size in bytes. When the settings package file exceeds this threshold the UE-V Agent will write a warning event to the event log.

If you enable this policy setting, the UE-V Agent checks the specified location once each day and updates its synchronization behavior based on the templates in this location. Settings location templates added or updated since the last check are registered by the UE-V Agent. The UE-V Agent deregisters templates that were removed from this location.
If you specify a UNC path and leave the option to replace the default Microsoft templates unchecked, the UE-V Agent will use the default Microsoft templates installed by the UE-V Agent and custom templates in the settings template catalog. If there are custom templates in the settings template catalog which use the same ID as the default Microsoft templates, they will be ignored.
If you specify a UNC path and check the option to replace the default Microsoft templates, all of the default Microsoft templates installed by the UE-V Agent will be deleted from the computer and only the templates located in the settings template catalog will be used.
If you disable this policy setting, the UE-V Agent will not use the custom settings location templates. If you disable this policy setting after it has been enabled, the UE-V Agent will not restore the default Microsoft templates.

      <string id="DisableWindowsOSSettings_Help">
This policy setting configures the synchronization of Windows settings between computers.
Certain Windows settings will synchronize between computers by default. These settings include Windows themes, Windows desktop settings, Ease of Access settings, and network printers. Use this policy setting to specify which Windows settings synchronize between computers. You can also use these settings to enable synchronization of users' sign-in information for certain apps, networks, and certificates.
If you enable this policy setting, only the selected Windows settings synchronize. Unselected Windows settings are excluded from settings synchronization.
If you disable this policy setting, all Windows Settings are excluded from the settings synchronization.
If you do not configure this policy setting, any defined values will be deleted.

      <string id="ConfigureSyncMethod">Configure Sync Method</string>
      <string id="ConfigureSyncMethod_Help">This policy setting configures the sync provider used by User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) to sync settings between users’ computers. With Sync Method set to ”SyncProvider,” the UE-V Agent uses a built-in sync provider to keep user settings synchronized between the computer and the settings storage location. This is the default value. You can disable the sync provider on computers that never go offline and are always connected to the settings storage location.
When SyncMethod is set to “None,” the UE-V Agent uses no sync provider. Settings are written directly to the settings storage location rather than being cached to sync later. 
Set SyncMethod to “External” when an external synchronization engine is being deployed for settings sync. This could use OneDrive, Work Folders, SharePoint or any other engine that uses a local folder to synchronize data between users’ computers. In this mode, UE-V writes settings data to the local folder specified in the settings storage path. These settings are then synchronized to other computers by an external synchronization engine. UE-V has no control over this synchronization. It only reads and writes the settings data when the normal UE-V triggers take place.
With notifications enabled, UE-V users receive a message when the settings sync is delayed. The notification delay policy setting defines the delay before a notification appears.
If you disable this policy setting, the sync provider is used to synchronize settings  between computers and the settings storage location.
