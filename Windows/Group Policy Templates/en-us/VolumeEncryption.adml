      <string id="ActiveDirectoryBackup_Help">This policy setting allows you to manage the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) backup of BitLocker Drive Encryption recovery information. This provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to lack of key information. This policy setting is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista.

If you enable this policy setting, BitLocker recovery information is automatically and silently backed up to AD DS when BitLocker is turned on for a computer. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: You might need to set up appropriate schema extensions and access control settings on the domain before AD DS backup can succeed. More information about setting up AD DS backup for BitLocker is available on Microsoft TechNet.

BitLocker recovery information includes the recovery password and some unique identifier data. You can also include a package that contains a BitLocker-protected drive's encryption key. This key package is secured by one or more recovery passwords and may help perform specialized recovery when the disk is damaged or corrupted.

If you select the option to "Require BitLocker backup to AD DS" BitLocker cannot be turned on unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. This option is selected by default to help ensure that BitLocker recovery is possible. If this option is not selected, AD DS backup is attempted but network or other backup failures do not prevent BitLocker setup. Backup is not automatically retried and the recovery password may not have been stored in AD DS during BitLocker setup.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker recovery information is not backed up to AD DS.

Note: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) initialization might occur during BitLocker setup. Enable the "Turn on TPM backup to Active Directory Domain Services" policy setting in System\Trusted Platform Module Services to ensure that TPM information is also backed up.

      <string id="ConfigureStartupUsage_Help">This policy setting allows you to control whether the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard will be able to set up an additional authentication method that is required each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note:  This policy is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista.

On a computer with a compatible Trusted Platform Module (TPM), two authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can require users to insert a USB flash drive containing a startup key. It can also require users to enter a 4-digit to 20-digit startup personal identification number (PIN).

A USB flash drive containing a startup key is needed on computers without a compatible TPM. Without a TPM, BitLocker-encrypted data is protected solely by the key material on this USB flash drive.

If you enable this policy setting, the wizard will display the page to allow the user to configure advanced startup options for BitLocker. You can further configure setting options for computers with and without a TPM.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the BitLocker setup wizard will display basic steps that allow users to turn on BitLocker on computers with a TPM. In this basic wizard, no additional startup key or startup PIN can be configured.
</string>

      <string id="ConfigureStartupUsage_Name">Require additional authentication at startup (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)</string>
      <string id="ConfigureAdvancedStartup_Name">Require additional authentication at startup</string>

      <string id="ConfigureAdvancedStartup_Help">This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode either a password or a USB drive is required for start-up. When using a startup key, the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable or if you have forgotten the password then you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can configure only basic options on computers with a TPM.

Note: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

</string>
      <string id="AllowNetworkUnlockAtStartup_Name">Allow network unlock at startup</string>
      <string id="AllowNetworkUnlockAtStartup_Help">This policy setting controls whether a BitLocker-protected computer that is connected to a trusted wired Local Area Network (LAN) and joined to a domain can create and use Network Key Protectors on TPM-enabled computers to automatically unlock the operating system drive when the computer is started.

If you enable this policy, clients configured with a BitLocker Network Unlock certificate will be able to create and use Network Key Protectors.

To use a Network Key Protector to unlock the computer, both the computer and the BitLocker Drive Encryption Network Unlock server must be provisioned with a Network Unlock certificate. The Network Unlock certificate is used to create Network Key Protectors, and protects the information exchanged with the server to unlock the computer. You can use the group policy setting "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies\BitLocker Drive Encryption Network Unlock Certificate" on the domain controller to distribute this certificate to computers in your organization. This unlock method uses the TPM on the computer, so computers that do not have a TPM cannot create Network Key Protectors to automatically unlock with Network Unlock.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker clients will not be able to create and use Network Key Protectors.

Note: For reliability and security, computers should also have a TPM startup PIN that can be used when the computer is disconnected from the wired network or the server at startup.

      <string id="ConfigureRecoveryUsage_Help">This policy setting allows you to control whether the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard can display and specify BitLocker recovery options. This policy is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Two recovery options can be used to unlock BitLocker-encrypted data in the absence of the required startup key information. The user either can type a 48-digit numerical recovery password or insert a USB flash drive containing a 256-bit recovery key.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the options that the setup wizard displays to users for recovering BitLocker encrypted data. Saving to a USB flash drive will store the 48-digit recovery password as a text file and the 256-bit recovery key as a hidden file. Saving to a folder will store the 48-digit recovery password as a text file. Printing will send the 48-digit recovery password to the default printer. For example, not allowing the 48-digit recovery password will prevent users from being able to print or save recovery information to a folder.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the BitLocker setup wizard will present users with ways to store recovery options.

Note: If Trusted Platform Module (TPM) initialization is needed during the BitLocker setup, TPM owner information will be saved or printed with the BitLocker recovery information.

Note: The 48-digit recovery password will not be available in FIPS-compliance mode.

Important: This policy setting provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to lack of key information. If you do not allow both user recovery options you must enable the "Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)" policy setting to prevent a policy error.

BitLocker's sensitivity to platform modifications (malicious or authorized) is increased or decreased depending upon inclusion or exclusion (respectively) of the PCRs. Specifically, setting this policy with PCR 7 omitted, will override the "Allow Secure Boot for integrity validation" group policy, preventing BitLocker from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation. Setting this policy may result in BitLocker recovery when firmware is updated. If you set this policy to include PCR 0, suspend BitLocker prior to applying firmware updates.

      <string id="IdentificationField_Help">This policy setting allows you to associate unique organizational identifiers to a new drive that is enabled with BitLocker. These identifiers are stored as the identification field and allowed identification field. The identification field allows you to associate a unique organizational identifier to BitLocker-protected drives. This identifier is automatically added to new BitLocker-protected drives and can be updated on existing BitLocker-protected drives using the manage-bde command-line tool. An identification field is required for management of certificate-based data recovery agents on BitLocker-protected drives and for potential updates to the BitLocker To Go Reader. BitLocker will only manage and update data recovery agents when the identification field on the drive matches the value configured in the identification field. In a similar manner, BitLocker will only update the BitLocker To Go Reader when the identification field on the drive matches the value configured for the identification field.

The allowed identification field is used in combination with the "Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker" policy setting to help control the use of removable drives in your organization. It is a comma separated list of identification fields from your organization or other external organizations.

You can configure the identification fields on existing drives by using manage-bde.exe.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the identification field on the BitLocker-protected drive and any allowed identification field used by your organization.

When a BitLocker-protected drive is mounted on another BitLocker-enabled computer the identification field and allowed identification field will be used to determine whether the drive is from an outside organization.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the identification field is not required.

Note: Identification fields are required for management of certificate-based data recovery agents on BitLocker-protected drives. BitLocker will only manage and update certificate-based data recovery agents when the identification field is present on a drive and is identical to the value configured on the computer. The identification field can be any value of 260 characters or fewer.

- AES 128 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2
- AES 256 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42

      <string id="EnablePrebootInputProtectorsOnSlates_Name">Enable use of BitLocker authentication requiring preboot keyboard input on slates</string>
      <string id="EnablePrebootInputProtectorsOnSlates_Help">This policy setting allows users to turn on authentication options that require user input from the pre-boot environment, even if the platform lacks pre-boot input capability.

The Windows touch keyboard (such as that used by tablets) isn't available in the pre-boot environment where BitLocker requires additional information such as a PIN or Password.

If you enable this policy setting, devices must have an alternative means of pre-boot input (such as an attached USB keyboard).

If this policy is not enabled, the Windows Recovery Environment must be enabled on tablets to support the entry of the BitLocker recovery password. When the Windows Recovery Environment is not enabled and this policy is not enabled, you cannot turn on BitLocker on a device that uses the Windows touch keyboard.

Note that if you do not enable this policy setting, options in the "Require additional authentication at startup" policy might not be available on such devices. These options include:
- Configure TPM startup PIN: Required/Allowed
- Configure TPM startup key and PIN: Required/Allowed
- Configure use of passwords for operating system drives.

      <string id="AllowSecureBootForIntegrity_Name">Allow Secure Boot for integrity validation</string>
      <string id="AllowSecureBootForIntegrity_Help">This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.

Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.

If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use Secure Boot for platform integrity if the platform is capable of Secure Boot-based integrity validation.

If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker will use legacy platform integrity validation, even on systems capable of Secure Boot-based integrity validation.

When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the "Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile" group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

Note: If the group policy setting "Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations" is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, Bitlocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.

Warning: Disabling this policy may result in BitLocker recovery when firmware is updated. If you disable this policy, suspend BitLocker prior to applying firmware updates.

If you select the "Use default recovery message and URL" option, the default BitLocker recovery message and URL will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. If you have previously configured a custom recovery message or URL and want to revert to the default message, you must keep the policy enabled and select the "Use default recovery message and URL" option.

If you select the "Use custom recovery message" option, the message you type in the "Custom recovery message option" text box will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. If a recovery URL is available, include it in the message.

If you select the "Use custom recovery URL" option, the URL you type in the "Custom recovery URL option" text box will replace the default URL in the default recovery message, which will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen.

Note: Not all characters and languages are supported in pre-boot. It is strongly recommended that you test that the characters you use for the custom message or URL appear correctly on the pre-boot recovery screen.
