Professional and Enterprise versions may select the Current Branch for Business (CBB) which is declared at the end of a Current Branch period and will be maintained for approximately 8 additional months.

A separate servicing branch intended for special purpose systems is the Long-Term Servicing Branch which will receive security updates for 10 years but excludes feature updates.
